# FAI-Project


QLearning_mk1 holds the code for the first iteration of Q-Learnign that due to scope change was later scrapped parted out for ideas:
The code above was one of the first iterations that I updated for our project with for the Q learning but the idea was halted as we moved away from using Gazeboo and ROS so we reverted back to going with a simpler model and idea. So this implementation was scrapped and existed only in our minds afterwards.
