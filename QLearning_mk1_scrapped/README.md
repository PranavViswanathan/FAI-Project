# FAI-Project


The code above was one of the first iterations that I updated for our project with for the Q learning but the idea was halted as we moved away from using Gazeboo and ROS so we reverted back to going with a simpler model and idea. So this implementation was scrapped and existed only in our minds afterwards.
